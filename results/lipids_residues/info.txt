This folder contains Reconciler results run on a modified lipidomics dataset that only contains lipids
residues (i.e., like 18:1, 24:0).

Mass spectrometry cannot resolve lipids with same mass, that can result from having different residues.
For example, PC P-16:0/16:1 (PC O-16:1/16:1) can either contain a 16:0 and a 16:1, or two 16:1 residues.
With *unambiguous* we mean we dropped such ties: no speculations are made to weigh those abundances, they
are just dropped.
